    "In X11 architecture, the client and the server are separated and can work on different machines. To use this approach, you need the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An X11 server running on your local machine. Linux comes with X11 server as a standard component (all desktop environments are using X11). On a Windows machine, you can set up third-party X11 implementations such\n",

    "\n",
    "2. The ability to log in to your remote machine via ssh, passing the –X command-line option: ssh –X servername. This enables X11 tunneling and allows all processes started in this session to use your local display for graphics output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you can start a program that uses the Monitor class and it will display the agent's actions, capturing the images into a video file."

In this chapter, we installed OpenAI Gym with tons of environments to play with, studied its basic API and created a randomly behaving agent.
