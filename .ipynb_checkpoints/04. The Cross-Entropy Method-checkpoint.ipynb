    "- __Model-free__ means that the agent takes current observations and does some computation on them, and the result is the action that it should take. In other words, the method directly connects observations to actions (or values that are related to actions).\n",

    "- __Policy-based:__ It approximates the policy of the agent\n",
    "- __On-policy:__ It requires fresh data obtained from the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The central thing in RL is the agent which it tries to accumulate as much total reward as possible. In practice, all of the complications of the agent is replaced with some kind of nonlinear trainable function. This function maps the agent's input (observations from the environment) to some output. Since the cross-entropy method is policy-based, then our nonlinear function (neural network) produces policy, that says for every observation which action the agent should take.\n",

    "<img width=\"500px\" src=\"./assets/high_level_RL.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The policy is usually represented as a probability distribution over actions. This is similar to a classification problem in which the number of classes is equal to the number of actions. This makes our agent very simple; It passes an observation from the environment to the network. Then it takes the probability distribution over actions, and perform random sampling using probability distribution to take an action. This random sampling adds randomness to our agent, which is a good thing. At the beginning of the training when our weights are random, the agent behaves randomly. After the agent takes an action in the environment, it obtains the next observation and reward for the last action. Then the loop continues.\n",

    "3. The rewards it received (from the action it took).\n",
    "\n",
    "In each episode, the total reward can be __discounted__ or not. For simplicity reasons, let's assume a discount factor of gamma = 1 (e.g. the sum of all local rewards for every episode). This total reward shows how good this episode was for the agent. Let's illustrate this with a diagram, which contains four episodes (note that different episodes have different values for O<sub>i</sub> , a<sub>i</sub> , and r<sub>i</sub> ):\n",

    "\n",
    "__The steps for the cross-entropy method are as follows:__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Play N number of episodes using our current model and environment.\n",
    "2. Calculate the total reward for every episode and decide on a reward boundary. Usually, we use some percentile of all rewards, such as 50th or 70th.\n",

    "4. Train on the remaining \"elite\" episodes using observations as the input and issued actions as the desired output.\n",
    "5. Repeat from step 1 until we become satisfied with the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the preceding procedure, our neural network learns how to repeat actions, which leads to a larger reward, constantly moving the boundary higher and higher. Despite the simplicity of this method, it works well in simple environments, it's easy to implement, and it's quite robust to hyperparameters changing, which makes it an ideal baseline method to try.

So, instead of calculating softmax and then calculating cross-entropy loss, we'll use the PyTorch class, __nn.CrossEntropyLoss__, which combines both softmax and cross-entropy in a single, more numerically stable expression.

    "In above, when the mean reward becomes greater than 199, we stop our training. Why 199? In Gym, the CartPole environment is considered to be solved when the mean reward for last 100 episodes is greater than 195, but our method converges so quickly that 100 episodes are usually what we need. The properly trained agent can balance the stick infinitely long (obtaining any amount of score), but the length of the episode in CartPole is limited to 200 steps (if you look at the environment variable of CartPole, you may notice the TimeLimit wrapper, which stops the episode after 200 steps). With all this in mind, we will stop training after the mean reward in the batch is greater than 199, which is a good indication that our agent knows how to balance the stick as a pro.\n",

There are only two kinds of episodes possible, with zero reward (failed) and one reward (successful), and failed episodes will obviously dominate in the beginning of the training. So, our percentile selection of \"elite\" episodes is totally wrong and gives us bad examples to train on. This is the reason for our training failure.\n",

    "- For training, our episodes have to be finite and, preferably, short\n",

    "- There is no intermediate indication about whether the agent has succeeded or failed\n",

    "Later in the book, we'll become familiar with other methods, which address these limitations. For now, if you're curious about how FrozenLake can be solved using cross-entropy, here is a list of tweaks of the code that you need to make (the full example is in __Chapter04/03_frozenlake_tweaked.py__):\n",
    "- __Larger batches of played episodes:__ <br>In CartPole, it was enough to have 16 episodes on every iteration, but FrozenLake requires at least 100 just to get some successful episodes.<br><br>\n",
    "- __Discount factor applied to reward:__ <br>To make the total reward for the episode depend on episode length, and add variety in episodes, we can use a discounted total reward with the discount factor 0.9 or 0.95. In this case, the reward for shorter episodes will be higher than the reward for longer ones.<br><br>\n",
    "- __Keeping \"elite\" episodes for a longer time:__ <br>In the CartPole training, we sampled episodes from the environment, trained on the best ones, and threw them away. In FrozenLake, a successful episode is a much rarer animal, so we need to keep them for several iterations to train on them.<br><br>\n",
    "- __Decrease learning rate:__ <br>This will give our network time to average more training samples.<br><br>\n",
    "- __Much longer training time:__ <br>Due to the sparsity of successful episodes, and the random outcome of our actions, it's much harder for our network to get an idea of the best behavior to perform in any particular situation. To reach 50% successful episodes, about 5k training iterations are required.<br><br>\n",

    "This section is optional and included for readers who are interested in why the method works. If you wish, you can refer to the original paper on cross-entropy, which will be given at the end of the section.\n",
    "The basis of the cross-entropy method lies in the importance sampling theorem, which states this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"600px\" src=\"assets/formula_1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In our RL case, H(x) is a reward value obtained by some policy x and p(x) is a distribution of all possible policies. We don't want to maximize our reward by searching all possible policies, instead we want to find a way to approximate p(x)H(x) by q(x), iteratively minimizing the distance between them. The distance between two probability distributions is calculated by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence which is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"600px\" src=\"assets/formula_2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The first term in KL is called entropy and doesn't depend on that, so could be omitted during the minimization. The second term is called cross-entropy and is a very common optimization objective in DL.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining both formulas, we can get an iterative algorithm, which starts with q0(x) = p(x) and on every step improves. This is an approximation of p(x)H(x) with an update:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"500px\" src=\"assets/formula_3.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a generic cross-entropy method, which can be significantly simplified in our RL case. Firstly, we replace our H(x) with an indicator function, which is 1 when the reward for the episode is above the threshold and 0 if the reward is below. Our policy update will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"500px\" src=\"assets/formula_4.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, the preceding formula misses the normalization term, but it still works in practice without it. So, the method is quite clear: we sample episodes using our current policy (starting with some random initial policy) and minimize the negative log likelihood of the most successful samples and our policy.\n",
    "There is a whole book dedicated to this method, written by Dirk P. Kroese. A shorter description can be found in the Cross-Entropy Method paper by Dirk P.Kroese ( https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/DirkKroese/ps/eormsCE.pdf )."
