This combination has the name __DQN__. At the end of the chapter, we'll reimplement a DQN algorithm from the famous paper, *Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning by V.

This method is called __replay buffer__. The simplest implementation is a buffer of fixed size, with new data added to the end of the buffer so that it pushes the oldest experience out of it. Replay buffer allows us to train on more-or-less independent data, but data will still be fresh enough to train on samples generated by our recent policy."

    "Another practical issue with the default training procedure is also related to the lack of i.i.d in our data, but in a slightly different manner. The Bellman equation provides us with the value of Q(s, a) via Q(s′, a′) (which has the name of __bootstrapping__). However, both states s and s′ have only one step between them. This makes them very similar and it's really hard for neural networks to distinguish between them. When we perform an update of our network's parameters, to make Q(s, a) closer to the desired result, we indirectly can alter the value produced for Q(s′, a′) and other states nearby. This can make our training really unstable, like chasing our own tail: when we update Q for state s, then on subsequent states we discover that Q(s′, a′) becomes worse, but attempts to update it can spoil our Q(s, a) approximation, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make training more stable, there is a trick, called __target network__, when we keep a copy of our network and use it for the Q(s′, a′) value in the Bellman equation. This network is synchronized with our main network only periodically, for example, once in N steps (where N is usually quite a large hyperparameter, such as 1k or 10k training iterations).\n"

    "Our RL methods use MDP formalism as their basis, which assumes that the environment obeys the Markov property: observation from the environment is all that we need to act optimally (in other words, our observations allow us\n",
    "to distinguish states from one another). As we've seen on the preceding Pong's screenshot, one single image from the Atari game is not enough to capture all important information (using only one image we have no idea about the speed and direction of objects, like the ball and our opponent's paddle). This obviously violates the Markov property and moves our single-frame Pong environment into the area of __partially observable MDPs (POMDP)__. A POMDP is basically MDP without the Markov property and they are very important in practice. For example, for most card games where you don't see your opponents' cards, game observations are POMDPs, because current observation (your cards and cards on the table) could correspond to different cards in your opponents' hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll not discuss POMPDs in detail in this book, so, for now, we'll use a small technique to push our environment back into the MDP domain. The solution is maintaining several observations from the past and using them as a state. In the case of Atari games, we usually stack k subsequent frames together and use them as the observation at every state. This allows our agent to deduct the dynamics of the current state, for instance, to get the speed of the ball and its direction. The usual \"classical\" number of k for Atari is four OR `k=4`. Of course, it's just a hack, as there can be longer dependencies in the environment, but for most of the games it works well."

    "Tackling Atari games with RL is quite demanding from a resource perspective. To make things faster, several transformations are applied to the Atari platform interaction, which are described in DeepMind's paper. Transformations are usually implemented as OpenAI Gym wrappers of various kinds. \n",
    "\n",
    "The full list is quite lengthy and there are several implementations of the same wrappers in various sources. My personal favorite is in the OpenAI repository called __baselines__, which is a set of RL methods and algorithms implemented in TensorFlow and applied to popular benchmarks, to establish the common ground for comparing methods. The repository is available from https://github.com/openai/baselines, and wrappers are available in this file: https://github.com/openai/baselines/blob/master/baselines/common/atari_wrappers.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full list of Atari transformations used by RL researchers includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  __Convert each lives in the game into seperate episode:__ <br>In general, an episode contains all the steps from the beginning of the game until the \"Game over\" screen, which can last for thousands of game steps. Also, in arcade games, the player is given several lives. Our transformation splits a full episode into individual small episodes. This usually helps to speed up convergence since our episodes become shorter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Perform random (up to 30) no-op actions in the beginning:__ <br> This stabilizes the training. However, there is no proper explanation why it is the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Make action decision every k steps (Usually `k=3` or `k=4`):__ <br> Since on intermediate frames, the chosen action is simply repeated. Then, this will speed up the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Take the maximum of every pixel in the last two frames and use it as an observation:__ <br> Some Atari games have a flickering effect, which is due to the platform's limitation (Atari has a limited amount of sprites that can be shown on a single frame). For a human eye, such quick changes are not visible, but they can confuse neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. __Pressing FIRE in the beginning of the game:__ <br> Some games (including Pong and Breakout) require a user to press the FIRE button to start the game. In theory, it's possible for a neural network to learn to press FIRE itself, but it will require much more episodes to be played. So, we press FIRE in the wrapper.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. __Scale each frame down from `210×160` (three color frames), into `84×84` (single-color):__ <br> Different approaches are possible. For example, the DeepMind paper describes this transformation as taking the Y-color channel from the YCbCr color space and then rescaling the full image to an 84 × 84 resolution. Some other researchers do grayscale transformation, cropping non-relevant parts of the image and then scaling down. In the Baselines repository (and in the following example code), the latter approach is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. __Stack subsequent frames (usually four) together:__ <br> This gives the network the information about the dynamics of the game's objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. __Clip rewards to -1, 0, 1:__ <br> Among different games, scores can vary wildly. This spread in reward values makes our loss have completely different scales between the games, which makes it harder to find common hyperparameters for a set of games. To fix this, reward just gets clipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. __Convert observations from unsigned bytes to float32 values and rescale:__ <br> The screen obtained from the emulator is encoded as a tensor of bytes with values from 0 to 255, which is not the best representation for a neural network. So, we need to convert the image into floats and rescale the values to the range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Pong example, we don't need some of the above wrappers, such as converting lives into separate episodes and reward clipping, so those wrappers aren't included in the example code. However, you should be aware of them, just\n",
    "in case you decide to experiment with other games. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, when the DQN is not converging, the problem is not in the code but in the wrongly wrapped environment. I've spend several days debugging convergence issues caused by missing the __FIRE__ button press at the beginning of a game!\n",

DeepMind kept all those parameters the same for all games (but trained individual models for every game), and it was the team's intention to show that the method is robust enough to solve lots of games with varying complexity, action space, reward structure, and other details using one single model architecture and hyperparameters. However, our goal here is much more modest: we want to solve just the Pong game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pong is quite simple and straightforward in comparison to other games in the Atari test set, so the hyperparameters in the paper are overkill for our task. For example, to get the best result on all 49 games, DeepMind used a million-observations replay buffer, which requires approximately 20 GB of RAM to keep and lots of samples from the environment to populate. The epsilon decay schedule that was used is also not the best for a single Pong game. In the training, DeepMind linearly decayed epsilon from 1.0 to 0.1 during the first million frames obtained from the environment. However, my own experiments have shown that for Pong, it's enough to decay epsilon over the first 100k frames and then keep it stable. The replay buffer can also be much smaller: 10k transitions will be enough. In the following example, I've used my parameters. These differ from the parameters in the paper but allow us to solve Pong about ten times faster. On a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, the following version converges to a mean score of 19.5 in one to two hours, but with DeepMind's hyperparameters it will require at least a day.\n",

    "This example is demanding on resources. On Pong, it requires about 400k frames to reach a mean reward of 17 (which means winning more than 80% of games). A similar number of frames will be required to get from 17 to 19.5, as our learning progress saturates and it's hard for the model to improve the score. \n",
    "  \n",
    "So, on average, a million frames are needed to train it fully. On the GTX 1080 Ti, I have a speed of about 150 frames per second, which is about two hours of training. On a CPU, the speed is much slower: about nine frames per second, which will take about a day and a half. Remember that this is for Pong, which is relatively easy to solve. Other games require hundreds of millions of frames and a 100 times larger experience replay buffer.\n",

    "In this chapter, we introduced lots of new and complex material. We became familiar with the limitations of value iteration in complex environments with large observation spaces and discussed how to overcome them with Q-learning. We checked the Q-learning algorithm on the FrozenLake environment and discussed the approximation of Q-values with neural networks and the extra complications that arise from this approximation. We covered several tricks for DQNs to improve their training stability and convergence, such as experience replay buffer, target networks, and frame stacking. Finally, we combined those extensions in to one single implementation of DQN that solves the Pong environment from the Atari games suite."
